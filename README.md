# RaceSync

Mobile-first sim racing schedule and practice planner for iOS and Android.

## Overview

RaceSync helps sim racers answer two fundamental questions:
1. **When are races happening?** View upcoming race schedules across multiple sim racing series
2. **What should I practice?** Plan practice sessions for the right conditions (track, car, time of day)

Built with React Native for true cross-platform mobile experience, designed for one-handed use while at your sim rig.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Offline-first race schedule viewing
- Calendar integration for race reminders
- Practice session planning
- Multi-sim support (iRacing, ACC, and more)
- Privacy-focused: your data stays on your device

## Development Principles

This project follows a comprehensive [constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) focused on:
- Mobile-first user experience
- Component independence & testability
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Performance & resource constraints
- Privacy-first data handling

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for complete development guidelines.
